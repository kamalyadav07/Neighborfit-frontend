# Research Findings & User Insights

## Existing Solutions Reviewed

- **99acres** and **MagicBricks** let users filter by rent, location, and property size.
- These platforms **do not support lifestyle-based filters** like proximity to colleges or cafes.
- **No weighting system** to prioritize personal preferences.

## Identified Gaps

- Lack of student-focused tools
- No customization of what's most important (safety vs affordability, etc.)
- Overwhelming choices without prioritization

## Hypotheses

> "Students would prefer to choose neighborhoods based on lifestyle factors like commute, safety, and cost â€” not just number of bedrooms."

This hypothesis was validated through design of the matching algorithm and preference sliders.

## Conclusion

There is a real need for a smarter, customizable way to discover student-friendly neighborhoods based on lifestyle fit.
